# ws-mod - modified version of [ws module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws) for WebSockets

Original WS module by Einaros is here: [https://github.com/websockets/ws](https://github.com/websockets/ws)

I have no rights for this library. I did not write any of the code in it. I only removed comments and put all the code in one module-file. And added a minified version as an alternative. I needed it to use without installing [ws module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws) from the npm.
